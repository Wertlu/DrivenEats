Model of a restaurant interactive menu.

This piece of work is an interface that facilitates restaurants to recieve online orders. The user can select the
items of the order, see how much the order is costing and send a Whatsapp message to the restaurant with the order.

# About

- It's a restaurant menu.
- You can choose your food by just tapping.
- After selecting one option in each section you can finish you order.
- In the resume windows you can see how much the order will cost.
- When you confirm the order you will be redirected to you Whatsapp in a conversation with the restaurant with your order already done.

I did this project because I know some restaurants lacks an interface that supply that needs.

In the future I intend to add a couter to each option to the client choose more than one item. Also, I intend to make the application recieve the menu through an API.
